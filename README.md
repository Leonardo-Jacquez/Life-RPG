# Life-RPG
RPG type program that uses current socio-economic inputs for people to "test" out life choices. 

Background:
  My wife is an educator who focuses on career/business/professional topics to middle schoolers. I am a firm beleiver that experience cannot be taught from a book and only hands on approaches can truly engrain the learning objectives into any person. I would like to create a program that uses real world statistics and inputs in order for a student to simulate what their life choices might yield. 
  For example, a student would choose a profession they aspire to. This profession will have educational requirements, salary, attrition, etc, associated with it. The student can then "begin" in high school, making simple decisions such as "choosing to study vs hanging out with friends" prior to an exam. Each decision will yield the opportunity for certain outcomes such as, "you we're too tired to focus and got a much lower score on your test" or "because you chose to study, you aced the test". These decisions will accumulate and compound further down the road where too many of a certain choice will affect the chances of success for future decisions. 
    Once "graduated" from "high school", the same process happens for "college/university/technical/trade schools". The bulk of the program is for a student to experience the decision making that comes post-high school. Such as money management, budgeting, calculating interest, career choices, etc. Ideally, all of these decisions will have inputs from current databases that show average prices for food, vehicles, homes/apartments, etc. A student will have to make those decisions based on the career they "worked towards", making use of the available salary, pay frequency, benefits, retirement contributions, etc.

Goal:
  The goal of this program is for students to use an interactive means to see the results of their decisions earlier in life. At certain increments discussions can be had as a class led by an instructor/teacher. Students should be encouraged to do what they want and not necessarily follow what their friends do. However, I know this will be inevitable and should be allowed since it will lead to the most likely outcome which is that not everyone likes to do the same things nor do they want the same life.
  One semester/year should entail a lifetime of decisions. I understand that this is a tall order, but ideally, I would like for each student ot be able to run through 3-4 Lives over the course of middle school/high school. 
  
Problems:
  I am not a software developer, and my coding ability is incredibly novice. This is my overly ambitious attempt to develop a additional income stream as I learn coding skills and project management.
  BY NO MEANS AM I LOOKING TO DO THIS MYSELF. IF ANYONE IS WILLING TO MENTOR/TEACH ME I WOULD BE MORE THAN GRATEFUL AND WILL GIVE DUE CREDIT FOR THE SUCCESS OF THIS PROJECT. This includes part ownership and entitlements to financial compensation, should this project prove successful.
